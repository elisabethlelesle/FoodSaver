Pre-trained Convolutional neural network (Actually it is a resnet), able to recognize 131 types of fruits
To use it, you have to first train it in model.py file, after a approximately 15 mins training, 
you will get a saved model file end with .pth. After you obtain the saved model, link libraries and use predict_in_c.cpp to make prediction.
