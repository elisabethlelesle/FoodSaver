I am in the design/User Interface team. What we need to do this is Web Assembly, Qt Designer. 
Right now, I am trying my best to download everything, and make everything work. 
Downloading Xcode rn. 

##2nd session: Monday 4th December from 1 to 3

I continue trying to download Qt creator, Qt design Studio and all the requierements to make it work and run. 
With the awefull WiFi it was really complicated

##3rd session: Thurday 7th December from 8 to 10

At home, I managed to download everything, so this morning I was able to get starting discovering the apps. 
First quest: in parrallel with Martin, find how to link a button to launch a function written in a cpp file. 
I find a path for solutions. It's the connections view where we can link user behavior to function calls.
