Build proper UI for the app, logic behind it
After: Connect UI logic with server communication


WEEK 10: 04/11/23 - 10/12/23
Setting up app UI project
Learning how to use QML and UI is harder than I thought, I found a decently large manual to learn and understand how to use it, but it might take a while...
Experimenting and tinkering with buttons and how to connect them to C++ functions.

WEEK 11: 11/12/23 - 17/12/23
Learning more about QML
Ditching the .ui and the design studio approach, QML is more functional and simpler to use and integrate with C++. Besides, we need a working thing soon.

WEEK 12: 18/12/23 - 24/12/23
Monday: finally getting a base app working. Includes page transitions and elementary c++ integration.
Thursday: reorganizing the github repo, removing redundant branches.
Organizing the team so that they can start building the pages during the holidays.
