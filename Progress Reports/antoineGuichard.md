Hello everyone, 

Good to see you there, I gonna detailled what I work on at each session. 

##1st session: Thursday 30th November from 8 to 11

I am in the design/User Interface team. What we need to do this is Web Assembly, Qt Designer. 
Right now, I am trying my best to download everything, and make everything work. 
Downloading Xcode rn. 

##2nd session: Monday 4th December from 1 to 3

I continue trying to download Qt creator, Qt design Studio and all the requierements to make it work and run. 
With the awefull WiFi it was really complicated

##3rd session: Thursday 7th December from 8 to 10

At home, I managed to download everything, so this morning I was able to get starting discovering the apps. 
First quest: in parrallel with Martin, find how to link a button to launch a function written in a cpp file. 
I find a path for solutions. It's the connections view where we can link user behavior to function calls. 

##4th session; Thursday 14th December from 8 to 10

So this monring, I wanted to create new files (hpp and cpp) to make the first classes and make the buttons connect to functions some people have coded. 
With the teacher, I created a new branch with a new project cause the first version were not so advanced anyways. but basically, what I created doesn't contains the QML files I wanted, so it was quite useless, still it took me 1h30. I restore Cyriac version, all this to realize my QT creator tthink i don't have Webassembly anymore. So I'll first fix this issue...
