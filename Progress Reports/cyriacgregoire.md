Progress Report

Week 1:
- Getting set up with Qt, indeed starting a new project file was not too easy.
- Start to set up the basic classes and implementing their basic functions in front.hpp, these are all the constructors, and destructors or .get_X() methods.

Week 2:
- I had a problem with the WebAssembly part of Qt, it was installing but never running, even though I seemed to have followed the same instructions as everyone else.
- Tried to solve the problem but I kept getting the same error which was difficult to interpret as I was not yet familiar with WebAssembly, Emscripten and how they work
- Finally decided to set up a virtual machine, that runs Ubuntu on my Laptop, which was a time-consuming solution, but it worked in the end!
