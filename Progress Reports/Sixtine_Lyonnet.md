I discussed what the visual and main features of the website with the front-end/app group.
I wrote the hpp file of the main classes with Cyriac: user, fridge, offer and ingredient.

I tried to set up my laptop by downloading all necessary extensions and different software to be able to create a website/app on QtCreator.

I wrote the User class in front.cpp. I also modified the hpp file accordingly. Finally, I corrected all bugs in those two files and reached out to my colleagues about what they need and expect of my team during the TD.

I corrected the bug in the pop_elt function of the Fridge class. I modified the front.hpp and front.cpp files accordingly. I also changed the hierarchy of the classes in the file to make it easier to code the cpp of the Offer class. This also makes the overall project more coherent. I discussed those changes with the different teams. I added the hpp declaration of the sort_ingredients function I want to add to the Fridge class.

I had an issue with Qt creator. I asked for help and was told I should delete it and download it again. This took a long time as there is terrible WiFi in the amphi.

12/12/2023
I finished downloading all necessary things for Qt.

13/12/2023
I added a Date class to the front.hpp file and defined the necessary classes in the cpp file.
I tested the functions and classes I created.
The TA told me defining things on the heap is considered bad practice so I put everything on the stack instead.

18/12/2023
I asked my collegues what I needed to implement to make the project work in the future and to make their work easier.
I kept working on my code and worked out a few major bugs in some functions.
I started to try and implement a function that compares a date with the current date in order to check if the ingredient is expired and/or expiring soon.

21/12/2023
I finished implementing the Date class.
I also added a method requested by my collegues.
I was told by my TA that the classes should be impplemented in separate cpp and h files, so I split the code from front.cpp and front.hpp in 5 different files.
