Progress Report#

Week 1 :
- understanding how to set up a new project file (namely test3)
- setting up the front.hpp and front.cpp file. These are the basic constuructors and functions of the classes we will use in the fron-end part of the project

Week 2:

- 
=======
- I had a problem with the WebAssembly part of Qt, it was installing but never running, even though I seemed to have followed the same instructions as everyone else.
- Tried to solve the problem but I kept getting the same error which was difficult to interpret as I was not yet familiar with WebAssembly, Emscripten and how they work
- Finally decided to set up a virtual machine, that runs Ubuntu on my Laptop, which was a time-consuming solution, but it worked in the end!

Week 3:
- Working on a transition between two pages using the Qt Design Studios, trying to understand how the Design Studio interface allows us to transition and connect diffrent "Flowitems". This has proven more difficult than it sounds as not many tutorials are available online. (This is not a very used way to create websites)

Week 4:
