Week 1: Nothing whatsoever!

Week 2:
Figured out the team structure more or less, will be coding with Poco - figuring out user -> server data sending and receiving, with Oscar. Updates to 
come later this week. Will see, it is only Monday after all. Anything can change, like the sky and sun and clouds above :)

Week 3:
Changed that! Coding using RPClib. We have now a working server, our team is slightly re-coordinated. Oscar is coordinated with frontend crew,
Esma and William and I are working on the server, database, and connection between html server and ours.
So, we have it all somewhat figured out! And github is still a mess but we'll manage. All is clear and well for now. Seas are clean too.
We'll figure out the server properly speaking over the next week, security and all. Logins, etc. hopefully. Adios!
