Progress Report

Week 1:

During the monday session we spent an hour splitting the group into smaller working groups. I decided to join the frontend group. The rest of the session was spent deciding on the general layout of the app and figuring out how to install Qt Designer. The thursdya session along with 4 hours at home were spent struggling to install the software.

Week 2:

Watched and followed many online tutorials to figure out the way Qt designer works. Nothing really worked and we could not figure out how to make a basic switch between pages.
