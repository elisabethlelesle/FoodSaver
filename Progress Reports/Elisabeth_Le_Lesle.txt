Weekly Progress Elisabeth Le Leslé
  
Session 1 : 27/11
   Brainstorm on different functionalities we could implement and add to the core server and app.
   Current ideas: 
    - photo recognition of unscannable items: research on convolutional neural networks and how to access the camera
      (would be using deep learning)
    - barcode scan: research on APIs that could translate photos of the barcode into a binary format
    - priority expirations (green to red): with the information of expiration dates, use a color code to see which foods should be eaten first to avoid waste
    - recipe ideas given the ingredients you have in your fridge: must determine whether we should use a generating AI or implement an ingredients choice option 
    - seeing people’s fridges: sort of like an Instagram for fridges, where one can add comments
