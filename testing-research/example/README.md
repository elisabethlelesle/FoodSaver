# Example Testing Server-Client
This is an example websocket server and its testing client (a webpage).
Only edit if you clearly know what you're doing, thanks.
*How to use?*
- (For first-time user) Make sure you have installed Python3, and both *python* and *pip* are in your *PATH*
- (For first-time user) In your console, install python dependencies with: ```user:~$ pip -r (current_directory)/requirements.txt```
- (For all users) Run test server: ```user:~$ python (current_directory)/example_server.py```
- The server is now running on localhost, testpage should now be served on *http://127.0.0.1:3333/*, you may now check the server output on your console and the client output on the testpage
