Weekly Progress Reports

Week 1: 20/11 - 24/11
Since I'm part of the Web Interface/App team, we began by discussing some main elements of what we would like to include visually in the interface of our project. I helped to create a draft of what we want the main page to look like, and also started discussing possible alternatives to how we could start coding it.

Week 2: 27/11 - 01/12
I struggled with downloading some of the extensions that we need to make a Qt Quick Application, which we figured out was the best approach to try and create our project for it to be able to be modified from Android and iOS. I didn't manage to make all the downloads and installs, but after asking one of the TAs and my teammates, I had what I needed to keep trying at home.

Week 3: 4/12 - 8/12
I managed to make progress in the install of extensions so I began with attempts to start building basic functions to make an app with Qt Quick. At first I also had a problem with understanding all the kits I should include and with the versions of Qt, but at the end I believe I made something work just fine for the first attempt. For future plans I would like to start exploring the visuals a bit more, so we can discuss next week as a team and know everyone's vision as well as being realistic about what to expect from our team and viceversa.
